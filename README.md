# "Skocko" game

The game is modeled after the game that is part of the mobile application "Slagalica". The game "Skoƒçko" is one of the seven games in the most popular Serbian quiz called Slagalica. The aim of the game is to find a combination of 4 symbols using 6 symbols. After making a combination of 4 symbols, it is necessary to confirm the combination. After that, the result will appear on the right. The red color indicates that one of the symbols is in the appropriate place, and the yellow color indicates that one of the symbol's place needs to be changed. When the circle is not colored, it means that the given combination has a symbol that is not in the requested combination. The game is limited to 60 seconds.
